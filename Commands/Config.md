# Git Config

When first setting up Git, you'll need to work with the Git config commands in order to set up your identity.

For example, your identity can be set up with the commands such as:

```
git config --global user.name "YOUR USERNAME"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

For more information, view the [First Time Git Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
